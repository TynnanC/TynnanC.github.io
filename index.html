            <md-block>
                I am a soon-to-be-graduate Macquarie University student studying a Bachelors of Commerce, majoring
                in Business
                Analytics, and a Bachelors of Information Technology, majoring in Web and Mobile Application
                Development.

                I'm from the Central Coast, and outside of work and studies find time to enjoy sports, music,
                tabletop card games, and video games. Two interesting facts about me:
                1. I am qualified gridiron positional coach. I have had the privilege to coach the Sydney University
                Womens Giridiron Team, and the NSW Coyotes (Womens state team).
                2. I visited China on a holiday when I was 14.

                This portfolio will help you learn more about me, and give you an opportunity to view some of my
                work and connect if you like what you see.
                Crew Coach at Hungry (March 2023 to present)
                My role was expanded to included being the primary person to train new crew members. This meant
                having a better understanding of all business tasks, and operating procedures
                for training related to work health and safety. This is a steppingstone while I start training with
                the goal of becoming a shift supervisor.

                Ballot counting for NSW State General Election (2019)
                - This role was primarily sorting and organizing ballot papers. This would involve first taking all
                of
                the ballot papers from each region, sorting them into groups based on candidate, secondly,
                we would form stacks of 100 ballots of each representative, and then finally submit electronically
                how
                many votes each candidate received. This was a 2-day contract.

                Back of house crew member at Hungry Jacks, West Gosford (November 2021 to March 2023)
                - My tasks vary depending on what time of day I start. If I start at 5am, I am focused on setting up
                the
                equipment and basic food needs ready to serve customers at 6am. Throughout the morning I
                am preparing food for the day (fresh food like cheese, tomatoes, sauces etc.), or preparing frozen
                foods
                that will defrost for use the following day (such as chicken and bacon). I was involved in making
                all the burgers, cooking fried foods like nuggets and fries, and maintaining level so there was
                enough
                cooked food for lunch and school rushes. I also helped with tasks like washing up, packing away
                food and dry goods when it is delivered, and general store upkeep like sweeping and crushing boxes.

        <div>

            <p>I tend to forget that people don’t have the experience that informs what I teach, and how.</p>
            <p>To fix this, I need to involve teaching why we are doing specific actions and what lead up to this
                decision.</p>
            <p>I also need to improve my public speaking, however this has already seen improvements by performing more
                customer service tasks.</p>

            <p>
                I don’t give myself enough credit for the small daily achievements like arriving to work on time and
                saying hello to co-workers. These are just small steps within the bigger achievements like making an
                effort in my education and having a plan for my future.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am my own worst critic, and I need to learn to give myself credit as well as critiques.

            <p>
                I want to foster a culture of learning wherever I go, trying to be a mentor, as having one has
                benefitted me in my gridiron ventures, and helped upskill me as an employee.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to continue helping women’s and grassroots sport. These groups need volunteers and have given me
                opportunities and experiences I will never forget.
