                I am a Macquarie University student studying a Bachelors of Commerce, majoring
                in Business
                Analytics, and a Bachelors of Information Technology, majoring in Web and Mobile Application
                Development.

                Macquarie University (2019 to 2023)
                - Bachelor of Commerce with a major in Business Analytics.
                - Bachelor of Information Technology with a
                major in web and mobile application development.

            <md-block>
                Ballot counting for NSW State General Election (2019)
                - This role was primarily sorting and organizing ballot papers. This would involve first taking all
                of
                the ballot papers from each region, sorting them into groups based on candidate, secondly,
                we would form stacks of 100 ballots of each representative, and then finally submit electronically
                how
                many votes each candidate received. This was a 2-day contract.

                Back of house crew member at Hungry Jacks, West Gosford (November 2021 to March 2023)
                - My tasks vary depending on what time of day I start. If I start at 5am, I am focused on setting up
                the
                equipment and basic food needs ready to serve customers at 6am. Throughout the morning I
                am preparing food for the day (fresh food like cheese, tomatoes, sauces etc.), or preparing frozen
                foods
                that will defrost for use the following day (such as chicken and bacon). I was involved in making
                all the burgers, cooking fried foods like nuggets and fries, and maintaining level so there was
                enough
                cooked food for lunch and school rushes. I also helped with tasks like washing up, packing away
                food and dry goods when it is delivered, and general store upkeep like sweeping and crushing boxes.

                Crew Coach at Hungry (March 2023 to present)
                - My role was expanded to included being the primary person to train new crew members. This meant
                having a better understanding of all business tasks, and operating procedures
                for training related to work health and safety. This is a stepping stone while I start training with
                the goal of becoming a shift supervisor.
